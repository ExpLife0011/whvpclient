Windows Hypervisor Platform client

Playing around with [Windows Hypervisor Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/api/).

Requires Windows 10 Pro with the [April 2018 Update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028685/windows-10-get-the-update). You'll also need to go to the Windows Features panel and enable the Windows Hypervisor Platform feature. Note that in doing so, you'll be unable to use any other virtualization platform (such as VirtualBox or VMware Player).
